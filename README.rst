Goals
-----

-  Completely written in python.
-  Fast. But **never** trade code readability for speed.
-  Easy set up.

Quickstart
~~~~~~~~~~

A `docker-compose </docker-compose.yml>`_ file is included to allow a fast and easy set up.

::

    docker-compose up

Note that a it's recommended to run the frontend and database separated from the
crawler since the last one generates a lot of traffic and can make a poor experience
for the users. You can read a guide about how to do this `here <https://stilio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/stilio/guides.html>`_.

FAQ
~~~

    The crawler speed is not so good.

Try to run this commands if you are on linux:

::

    iptables -I OUTPUT -t raw -p udp --sport PORT_NUMBER -j NOTRACK
    iptables -I PREROUTING -t raw -p udp --dport PORT_NUMBER -j NOTRACK
